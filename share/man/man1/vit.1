.SH NAME
VIT \- Visual Interactive Taskwarrior

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vit [-audit] <filter>

.SH DESCRIPTION
VIT (Visual Interactive Taskwarrior) is a lightweight, curses-based front end
for Taskwarrior that provides a convenient way to quickly navigate and process
tasks. VIT allows you to interact with tasks in a Vi-intuitive way.

A goal of VIT is to allow you to customize the way in which you use
Taskwarrior's core commands as well as to provide a framework for easily
dispatching external commands (both user scripts and Taskwarrior's many
external scripts). For more information on this, see vitrc(5).

.SH FILTER
The <filter> consists of zero or more search criteria that select tasks.  For
more information on this, see task(1).

.SH AUDIT
Using the -audit option is for debugging purposes and gives more information
on what's going on behind the scenes.
