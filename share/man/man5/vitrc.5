.SH NAME
vitrc \- Configuration file for the vit(1) command

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B $HOME/.vitrc

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B VIT
obtains its configuration data from a file called
.I .vitrc
\&. This file must be located in the user's home directory.

Except for comments (lines starting with "#"), currently the only acceptable
commands in .vitrc are map commands. They take the form

.RS
map <KEY>=<KEY-SEQUENCE>
.RE

where:
.RS
.TP
<KEY>
should represent a key or combination of keys, such as "a" or a <KEY-CODE> as
listed below.

.P
and
.P
<KEY-SEQUENCE>
is a sequence of <KEY>s to emulate. The result should be the same as if these
keys were pressed manually by the user.

<KEY-CODE>s are strings that represent keys. The following may be used:
.br
Function keys: <F1> <F2> <F3> <F4> <F5> <F6> <F7> <F8> <F9> <F10> <F11> <F12>

Navigation keys: <Home> <End> <PageUp> <PageDown> <Up> <Down> <Right> <Left>

Editing keys: <Insert> <Del> <Backspace> <Space> <Tab> <Return>

Modifier combinations: \\ca for Ctrl + "a" combination.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS EXTERNAL COMMANDS
Note that for many of the examples, you need to have the appropriate extension
installed and in your PATH. Recall that after :! a 'w' means that VIT should
"wait". This allows another command to take over (e.g. Vim when you're editing
a task) and for you to see the output of a command. After :! a 'r' means that
VIT should reread your list of tasks. This should be used when your external
command changes the task data.

.TP
.B map \\\\cn=:!wr tasknote %TASKID<Return>
When Ctrl + n is pressed, runs the command 'tasknote <ID>', where <ID> is the
ID of the task that is currently selected in VIT.

.TP
.B map c=:! task %TASKID rc.defaultwidth:200 | grep -o -P -m 1 "(ftp|http)s?://\S*" | tr -d '\n' | xsel -b<Return>
Copies the first link it finds to the clipboard.

.TP
.B map Z=:!rw echo "Changing due date\n"; task %TASKID modify due:$(read -p "How many days? " DAYS; echo $DAYS)days<Return>
Asks you for input and then changes the due date of the selected task to NOW plus that many days.

.TP
.B map <Left>=:!wr task $(task _get %TASKID.parent) edit<Return>
When the left arrow key is pressed, edits the parent of a recurring task
(do not use on non-recurring task).

.SS INTERNAL COMMANDS
.TP
.B map Q=
Disables whatever the Q key is bound to internally in VIT, which is a quick quit.
